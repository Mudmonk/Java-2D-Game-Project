# Java-2D-Game-Project
This is a personal project aiming to create a 2D adventure game with RPG mechanics through Java.

My main goal is to become familiar with the the challenges this type of project faces and find creative solutions and implementations
to overcome those challenges.

The end goal is to have a fully functional and lightweight game.
